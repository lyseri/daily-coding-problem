    <h1>Coding Challenge #2</h1>

    <h2>Challenge:</h2>

    <p>Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.<br><br>

        This problem was asked by Uber.<br><br>
        
        Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.<br><br>
        
        For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].<br><br>
        
        Follow-up: what if you can't use division?<br><br></p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <code>The function productWithout() can be tested in the console.</code>
